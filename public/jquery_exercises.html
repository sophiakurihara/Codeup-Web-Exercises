			<h3>If You Forget Me</h3>
				<p>
							I want you to know
							<br>
							one thing. 
							<br>
							You know how this is: 
							<br>
							if I look 
							<br>
							at the crystal moon, at the red branch 
							<br>
							of the slow autumn at my window, 
							<br>
							if I touch 
							<br>
							near the fire 
							<br>
							the impalpable ash 
							<br>

							or the wrinkled body of the log, 
							<br>

							everything carries me to you, 
							<br>

							as if everything that exists, 
							<br>

							aromas, light, metals, 
							<br>

							were little boats 
							<br>

							that sail 
							<br>

							toward those isles of yours that wait for me. 
							<br>
							

							Well, now, 
							<br>

							if little by little you stop loving me 
							<br>

							I shall stop loving you little by little. 
							<br>
							

							If suddenly 
							<br>

							you forget me 
							<br>

							do not look for me, 
							<br>

							for I shall already have forgotten you. 
							<br>
							
							If you think it long and mad, 
							<br>
							the wind of banners 
							<br>
							that passes through my life, 
							<br>
							and you decide 
							<br>
							to leave me at the shore 
							<br>
							of the heart where I have roots, 
							<br>
							remember 
							<br>
							that on that day, 
							<br>
							at that hour, 
							<br>
							I shall lift my arms 
							<br>
							and my roots will set off 
							<br>
							to seek another land. 
							<br>
							
							But 
							<br>
							if each day, 
							<br>
							each hour, 
							<br>
							you feel that you are destined for me 
							<br>
							with implacable sweetness, 
							<br>
							if each day a flower 
							<br>
							climbs up to your lips to seek me, 
							<br>
							ah my love, ah my own, 
							<br>
							in me all that fire is repeated, 
							<br>
							in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten, 
							<br>
							my love feeds on your love, beloved, 
							<br>
							and as long as you live it will be in your arms 
							<br>
							without leaving mine.

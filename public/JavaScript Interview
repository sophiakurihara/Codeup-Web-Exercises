- JavaScript is supplementary to html and css, and allows for user interactivity on websites.
- JavaScript data types are string, boolean, number, null, undefined, objects, functions, arrays.
- True and False: empty string - false, 0 - false, isNaN - false, !! SHOULD evaluate to true. any non empty string is true. any numercal # !0 is true.true == true, false == false. There is an order of operations when evaluating boolean statements

- Three UI methods: alert, prompt, confirm
- Ways to create an array: literal array notation var = [], and object constructor : var = newArray();
- Loops: while, do-while, for loops, for-each.
- switch statements are conditional statements used to check for one condition; in effect works simiarly as an if-else statement. COMPILES into something FASTER than an if-else.
- ternary is also a conditional statement, works as a shorthand if-else

- recursion : function that calls upon itself (loop)
- parameter = argument
- functions are first-class citizens can be used as, or stored in variables, passed as an argument for a function, or returned as a value from a function
- function with no return statement = undefined
- hoisting : is when variables declared in a scope will get declarations moved to the beginning of a function
- IFFE : to avoid global variables and other functions from bleeding out into your other code. allows it to be in one self-contained module.
